we can create a simple console-based application in Python that uses file handling to store and retrieve user data. We can break down the task into three stages:
Stage 1: Registration
1)Take user input for email/username and password.
2)Validate email/username and password as per the given criteria.
3)f validation fails, show an error message and ask the user to enter 4)valid email/username and password.
5)If validation succeeds, store the data in a file.
Stage 2: Storing Data in a File
1)Create a file (e.g., users.txt) to store the registered user data.
2)For each registered user, store their email/username and password in the file as a string separated by a delimiter (e.g., ',').
Stage 3: Login
1)Take user input for email/username and password.
2)Read the data from the file (users.txt) and check if the user exists in the file based on the entered email/username and password.
3)If the user exists, show a success message and allow them to access their account.
4)If the user does not exist, show an error message and ask them to register or try again with valid credentials.
5)If the user forgets their password, retrieve their original password based on their username and show it to them.
6)If the user wants to change their password, ask them to enter a new password and update the file with the new password.
